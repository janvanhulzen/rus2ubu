To install Moteus GUI on a fresh install of Ubuntu 22.04 a few steps are needed. I am by no means an 
expert on the use of linux so some steps may be redundant or obsolete after july 2024.

Start with:

$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Check the python veriosn with

$ python3 --version

It appears that Ubuntu 22.04 has python3.10. The next step is to setup pip

sudo apt install python3-pip -y

Install the matplotlib library

$ pip3 install matplotlib

To enable a reliable software enviroment a few packages need to be installed.

$ sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev

The Next step is to set up a virtual enviroment to safely use python without interfering with 
system packages. 

$ sudo apt install python3-venv -y

Next create a directory for the venv. In this case

$ mkdir moteus
$ cd moteus

Set up the actual enviroemet with

$ python3 -m venv gui_env

and activate it with

$ source ~/moteus/gui_env/bin/activate

in order to deactivate it use 

$ deactivate

With the virtual enviroment active install the moteus gui using

$ pip3 install moteus_gui

Start the gui using

$ python3 -m moteus_gui.tview --devices=1

At this point some errors may pop up most notably an error stating that Numpy 2.0.0 does not mix
with packages intended for or compiled with Numpy 1.0.0. Investigate this using
We krijgen nu een error over numpy package.

$ python3
$ import numpy 
$ numpy.__version__

Indeed the version is 2.0.0. Downgrade this to 1.26.4 using

$ pip install --upgrade numpy==1.26.4

which is the last package before 2.0.0 and dates from february 6 2024. Having fixed the numpy problem
a second problem may emerge. This problem is related to QT. Investigate using

$ export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1

when running 

$ python3 -m moteus_gui.tview --devices=1

angain. It appears that the error is related ti a missing QT package named libxcb-xinerama0. 

The solution to this problem is found (using google) 

$ sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0
$ sudo apt-get install libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xfixes0 libegl1-mesa

Do not forget that the canusb device needs a few steps as is outlined on 

https://github.com/mjbots/fdcanusb/blob/master/70-fdcanusb.rules

which states that the file 70-fdcanusb.rules should be downloaded and copied into /etc/udev/rules.d

# Install into /etc/udev/rules.d:
sudo cp ~/Downloads/70-fdcanusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=tty
